# Writing Mechanics Guide - Anti-AI Detection & Human Voice

## PURPOSE
This guide ensures content sounds like a local real estate expert, not an AI content generator. Follow these patterns to pass AI detection and engage readers naturally.

---

## üé≠ CORE WRITING PHILOSOPHY

**Write like:**
- A knowledgeable local agent having a conversation
- Someone who lives and works in South Jersey
- An expert who's seen hundreds of transactions
- A real person with opinions and personality

**Don't write like:**
- A corporate press release
- An academic research paper
- A generic content mill article
- A chatbot trying to sound helpful

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è SENTENCE STRUCTURE (STRICT)

### Length Targets
- **10-15 words:** Target for 75% of sentences
- **16-20 words:** Maximum for remaining 25%
- **21+ words:** REWRITE (absolute max: 25 words)

### Why This Matters
Long sentences trigger AI detection. Short, punchy sentences sound human.

### Examples

‚ùå **TOO LONG (29 words):**
"While many factors contribute to the overall health of the real estate market, supply and demand dynamics remain the primary driver of price trends across South Jersey."

‚úÖ **BETTER (Three short sentences, 26 words total):**
"What drives home prices? Supply and demand. When inventory stays low and buyers keep competing, prices go up. Simple as that."

---

## üó£Ô∏è ACTIVE VOICE REQUIREMENT

**Target:** 95% active voice minimum

### Active vs. Passive

‚ùå **PASSIVE:** "The house was sold by the agent in three days."  
‚úÖ **ACTIVE:** "The agent sold the house in three days."

‚ùå **PASSIVE:** "Prices are expected to rise by experts."  
‚úÖ **ACTIVE:** "Experts expect prices to rise."

‚ùå **PASSIVE:** "Offers were received within hours."  
‚úÖ **ACTIVE:** "We received offers within hours."

---

## üö´ AI GIVEAWAY PHRASES (NEVER USE)

### Opening Clich√©s
‚ùå "In today's market..."  
‚ùå "In the current landscape..."  
‚ùå "In an ever-changing market..."  
‚úÖ Just start with your point: "Home prices keep climbing."

### Academic Transitions
‚ùå "Moreover..."  
‚ùå "Furthermore..."  
‚ùå "Additionally..."  
‚ùå "In conclusion..."  
‚úÖ Use: "Plus," "Also," "And another thing," "Look," "Here's the deal"

### Hedging Language
‚ùå "It's important to note that..."  
‚ùå "It's worth mentioning that..."  
‚ùå "It should be noted that..."  
‚úÖ Just state it directly: "Here's what matters:"

### Corporate Speak
‚ùå "Truth is..."  
‚ùå "Just to give you a rough idea..."  
‚ùå "Expertise that pays for itself"  
‚ùå "Hit the market with confidence"  
‚ùå "Synergy," "leverage," "optimize"  
‚úÖ Use plain English

### Pattern Recognition Triggers
‚ùå "Whether it's X, Y, or Z..."  
‚ùå "First... Second... Third..."  
‚ùå "For the pessimists... For the optimists..."  
‚úÖ Mix up your structure, break patterns

### Formal Citations
‚ùå "According to research from the National Association of Realtors (NAR)..."  
‚úÖ "NAR says..." or "Recent data shows..." or just state the fact

### Generic Filler
‚ùå "Various factors..."  
‚ùå "Multiple aspects..."  
‚ùå "A number of considerations..."  
‚úÖ Be specific or skip it

## ‚úÖ HUMAN WRITING PATTERNS (USE THESE)

### 1. Incomplete Thoughts That Complete
Make your writing conversational by using fragments.

**Examples:**
- "The market? Actually stronger than expected."
- "Prices in Cherry Hill? Still climbing."
- "That new development on Route 73? Sold out in weeks."

### 2. Rhetorical Questions
Ask and answer your own questions.

**Examples:**
- "Why should you care? Because timing matters."
- "What's driving this? Not enough houses, too many buyers."
- "Will it last? Nobody has a crystal ball, but the fundamentals look solid."

### 3. Mild Contradictions
Show you've changed your mind based on evidence.

**Examples:**
- "I used to think rates would crater prices. The data says otherwise."
- "Everyone predicted a crash. Didn't happen."
- "Sure, experts warned us. They were wrong."

### 4. Specific, Unexpected Examples
Use ultra-local, ultra-specific details.

**Examples:**
- "Like that colonial on Kresson Road that sold for $485K in March."
- "Remember the bidding war on Haddonfield-Berlin Road last fall?"
- "You know that new Wawa on Route 73? Houses nearby jumped 8% since it opened."

### 5. Natural Skepticism
Show healthy doubt, don't blindly trust "experts."

**Examples:**
- "Sure, some experts claim rates will drop to 3%. I'll believe it when I see it."
- "Everyone says spring is the best time to sell. Maybe. Depends on your situation."
- "Zillow estimates are nice. They're also wrong about 40% of the time."

### 6. Personal Observations
Write like you've actually seen these things happen.

**Examples:**
- "I've watched buyers waive inspections all year."
- "Three times this month, I've seen houses sell over asking."
- "Just last Tuesday, a client lost their fourth bidding war."

## üé™ THE UNPREDICTABILITY RULE

Every 3-4 paragraphs, do something unexpected to break AI patterns:

### One-Word Sentences
"Seriously."  
"Nope."  
"Always."  
"Never."

### Ultra-Specific References
- "Remember when that house on Haddonfield-Berlin Road..."
- "Check out the split-levels near the Acme on Route 70."
- "January 2024 was wild."

### Mild Opinions
- "Smart move, if you ask me."
- "That's the best strategy I've seen."
- "Risky, but sometimes it works."

### Parenthetical Asides
- "Most buyers (though not all) prefer updated kitchens."
- "Spring is busy season (assuming normal weather)."
- "Rates matter (obviously), but so does inventory."

### Challenge Conventional Wisdom
- "Everyone says X, but that's outdated advice."
- "The old rule was 20% down. Times have changed."
- "Sure, staging helps. But pricing matters more."

## üéØ ENGAGEMENT HOOKS

### Opening Hook (First 50 Words)
Choose ONE approach:

**1. Question Hook**
"What if South Jersey home prices dropped 20% tomorrow?"

**2. Statistic Hook**
"87% of Gloucester County sellers miss this critical step."

**3. Story Hook**
"Last month, a Cherry Hill family discovered their house was worth $50K more than they thought."

**4. Contradiction Hook**
"Everyone thinks rates kill deals. Here's why they're wrong."

### Micro-Hooks (Every 150 Words)
Insert engagement devices regularly:

- "Here's what most people miss..."
- "The surprising part?"
- "But there's a catch..."
- "This changes everything..."
- "Want to know the real reason?"
- "Here's what nobody tells you..."

### Bucket Brigades
Start key paragraphs with transitions that pull readers forward:

- "Here's the deal:"
- "Bottom line?"
- "Even better:"
- "What's more:"
- "The reality:"
- "Look:"

---

## üìñ READABILITY TARGETS

### Flesch Reading Ease Score
**Target: 75-85**

This means:
- 8th-9th grade reading level
- Easy for anyone to understand
- Conversational, not academic

### How to Hit This Target
1. Short sentences (10-15 words)
2. Simple words (avoid jargon)
3. Active voice
4. Personal pronouns (you, we, I)
5. Contractions (it's, don't, won't)

---

## ‚ö° BEFORE/AFTER EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Pricing Discussion

‚ùå **AI VERSION:**
"Truth is, from fixing little issues to decluttering, starting earlier means less stress. Whether it's that leaky bathroom faucet, the scuffed front door, or bigger issues like an aging roof, addressing these items proactively will help you avoid complications during the inspection process."

‚úÖ **HUMAN VERSION:**
"Start fixing stuff now. That dripping faucet isn't getting better on its own. Scuffed front door? Twenty bucks of paint does wonders. But that 20-year-old roof? That's gonna cost you. Better to know now than after you're under contract."

### Example 2: Market Analysis

‚ùå **AI VERSION:**
"According to research from the National Association of Realtors (NAR), the ongoing shortage of housing inventory continues to push prices upward across the region, demonstrating remarkable resilience in the face of higher interest rates."

‚úÖ **HUMAN VERSION:**
"NAR says we still don't have enough homes. Hasn't changed in three years, probably won't change next year either. That's why prices keep climbing even with higher rates."

### Example 3: Expert Advice

‚ùå **AI VERSION:**
"That's expertise that pays for itself. A professional real estate agent brings valuable market knowledge and negotiation skills to the table, helping you navigate complex transactions with confidence."

‚úÖ **HUMAN VERSION:**
"Good agents earn their commission on this stuff alone. They know the market, they've done hundreds of deals, and they'll catch problems before they blow up your sale."

### Example 4: Home Prep Tips

‚ùå **AI VERSION:**
"Better to address problems upfront than have a deal fall apart later. Taking time to properly prepare your home for sale demonstrates transparency and builds buyer confidence."

‚úÖ **HUMAN VERSION:**
"Fix it now or lose the sale later. I've seen it happen dozens of times. Buyers find problems during inspection, freak out, and walk away. Don't be that seller."

---

## üîÑ PATTERN BREAKING EXAMPLES

### Avoid Predictable Lists

‚ùå **PREDICTABLE:**
"First, consider location. Second, examine price. Third, evaluate condition."

‚úÖ **HUMAN:**
"Location matters, obviously. But here's what really moves the needle: price per square foot compared to the neighborhood average. Condition? That's negotiable."

### Avoid Parallel Structures

‚ùå **PREDICTABLE:**
"For pessimists, prices will rise 5%. For realists, prices will rise 15%. For optimists, prices will rise 26%."

‚úÖ **HUMAN:**
"Look, nobody's expecting prices to tank. Even the doom-and-gloomers admit we're looking at 5% growth. Most folks? They're betting on 15% by 2029. The real optimists - and there are plenty in Moorestown - think we'll hit 26%."

### Avoid Corporate Motivation Speak

‚ùå **CORPORATE:**
"Want to know which projects will give you the biggest return? Let's explore strategic home improvements that maximize your investment."

‚úÖ **HUMAN:**
"Some upgrades actually make money. Others? Total waste. Kitchen and bathrooms pay off. That fancy accent wall? Probably not worth it."

---

## üìù SENTENCE VARIETY EXAMPLES

Mix these sentence patterns to avoid monotony:

**Short declarative:** "Prices went up."  
**Fragment:** "Way up."  
**Question:** "Why?"  
**Longer explanation:** "Not enough houses, too many buyers."  
**Observation:** "Same story we've been seeing for three years."  
**Opinion:** "Doesn't look like it'll change anytime soon, either."

See how that flows? Natural rhythm, varied structure, conversational tone.

## üöÄ REMEMBER

Good writing sounds like a conversation with a knowledgeable friend. Bad writing sounds like a robot trying to fill space.

When in doubt, read it out loud. If it sounds weird, rewrite it.
