## üé≠ HUMAN WRITING REQUIREMENTS (ANTI-AI DETECTION)

### Write Like a Local Expert, Not a Robot
1. **Vary sentence structure** - Mix short, medium, and long randomly
2. **Add personality quirks** - Use casual asides, mild opinions, local flavor
3. **Break patterns** - Never use predictable sequences (pessimists/optimists, first/second/third)
4. **Include unexpected details** - Specific streets, local businesses, personal observations
5. **Use natural transitions** - Avoid "Moreover," "Furthermore," "In conclusion"
6. **Sprinkle in conversational elements** - "Look," "Here's the thing," "Truth is"

### Geographic Mentions - NATURAL DISTRIBUTION
- **Target: 3-5 mentions of "South Jersey" TOTAL** (not 8!)
- Use variations: "the area," "locally," "around here," "our market"
- Make geographic references feel organic, not forced
- Use specific towns for stories, not just as keyword insertions

### Human Writing Patterns to Include
1. **Incomplete thoughts that complete**: "The market? It's actually holding steady."
2. **Rhetorical questions**: "Why should you care? Because..."
3. **Mild contradictions**: "I used to think X, but the data shows Y"
4. **Specific anecdotes**: "Just last Tuesday, a client told me..."
5. **Natural skepticism**: "Sure, some experts claim X, but let's be real..."
6. **Local references**: "You know that new development near the Acme?"

### AI Red Flags to AVOID
‚ùå **Never Write:**
- "In today's market" / "In the current landscape"
- "It's important to note" / "It's worth mentioning"
- "Moreover" / "Furthermore" / "Additionally"
- "Various factors" / "Multiple aspects"
- Perfect parallel structures (First... Second... Third...)
- Forced geographic insertions ("Gloucester County buyers")
- Academic phrases ("stems from," "comprises," "pertains to")

‚úÖ **Write Instead:**
- Start with the point directly
- Use "Plus," "Also," "And another thing"
- Mix up your list structures
- Natural geographic mentions ("buyers in Gloucester County")
- Plain English ("comes from," "includes," "relates to")

### The Unpredictability Rule
Every 3-4 paragraphs, do something unexpected:
- Drop in a one-word sentence. "Seriously."
- Ask and answer your own question
- Reference something ultra-specific (a local intersection, a specific month)
- Add a mild opinion: "Smart move, if you ask me."
- Use parentheses for an aside (though not everyone agrees)

## üìç GEOGRAPHIC OPTIMIZATION (HUMAN-SOUNDING)

### Natural Geographic Distribution
- **"South Jersey" mentions: 3-5 TOTAL in entire article**
- **Specific towns: 4-5 mentions maximum**
- **Make it conversational:** "around here," "locally," "in our area," "this market"

### The Organic Location Method
Instead of forcing geography, weave it naturally:
- ‚ùå "Gloucester County buyers face challenges"
- ‚úÖ "Buyers in Gloucester County? They're dealing with..."
- ‚ùå "South Jersey real estate markets show growth"
- ‚úÖ "Real estate around here keeps growing"

### Location Selection Strategy
**Tier 1 Towns** (Use 1-2 naturally):
- Cherry Hill, Moorestown, Washington Township, Mount Laurel

**Tier 2 Towns** (Use 1-2 for examples):
- Voorhees, Marlton, Medford, Haddonfield, Woolwich

**NEVER Feature:**
- Camden City, Gloucester City, Paulsboro, Salem City

### After Geographic Mentions, Rotate Through:
- "around here"
- "locally" 
- "in this market"
- "the area"
- "our region"
- "nearby"
- [Just continue without geographic reference]

## üéØ HOOK & ENGAGEMENT FORMULA

### Opening Hook (First 50 Words)
Choose ONE:
1. **Question:** "What if South Jersey home prices dropped 20% tomorrow?"
2. **Statistic:** "87% of Gloucester County sellers miss this critical step."
3. **Story:** "Last month, a Cherry Hill family discovered..."
4. **Contradiction:** "Everyone thinks rates kill deals. Here's why they're wrong."

### Micro-Hooks (Every 150 Words)
Insert ONE:
- "Here's what most people miss..."
- "The surprising truth?"
- "But there's a catch..."
- "This changes everything..."

### Bucket Brigades
Start key paragraphs with:
- "Here's the deal:"
- "Bottom line?"
- "Even better:"
- "What's more:"

## üöÄ SEO OPTIMIZATION (YOAST-COMPLIANT)

### CRITICAL KEYPHRASE RULES
1. **Keyphrase Selection:**
   - Maximum 4 content words (e.g., "South Jersey home prices" NOT "South Jersey real estate home prices")
   - Make it specific to THIS article (avoid reusing across posts)
   - Choose natural phrases people actually search

2. **Mandatory Keyphrase Placement:**
   - **First paragraph:** MUST include exact keyphrase or close variant
   - **SEO title:** Include EXACT match at the BEGINNING
   - **Meta description:** Include exact keyphrase within 156 characters
   - **Throughout text:** Minimum 2-3 times for 1000 words, 3-4 times for 1500+ words
   - **Image alt text:** Include keyphrase in at least 50% of image alt attributes

3. **Keyphrase Density Formula:**
   - 500-1000 words: 2-3 mentions
   - 1000-1500 words: 3-4 mentions  
   - 1500-2000 words: 4-5 mentions
   - Never exceed 1% density (avoid over-optimization)

### SEO TITLE REQUIREMENTS

### META DESCRIPTION FORMULA

- Partial match: "South Jersey prices" or "local home prices"
- Synonyms: "South Jersey property values"

---

## üìä LOCAL VALUE INJECTION

### INCLUDE When Relevant:
- **Market Stats:** "Camden County median prices rose 4.2%..."
- **Specific Examples:** "A Marlton colonial sold in 5 days..."
- **NJ Programs:** Only if topic involves financing/assistance
- **Property Tax Context:** Only if discussing costs
- **Commute Data:** Only if location benefits are central

## ‚ö° HUMAN REWRITING EXAMPLES

### From AI-Sounding to Human

**AI Version:**
"Even the pessimists project a 5% increase. Overall, prices are expected to rise 15%. Optimists predict a 26% increase."

**Human Version:**
"Look, nobody's expecting prices to tank. Even the doom-and-gloomers admit we're looking at 5% growth. Most folks? They're betting on 15% by 2029. The real optimists - and there are plenty in Moorestown - think we'll hit 26%."

**AI Version:**
"The main reason we're not heading for another 2008 is simple: supply and demand."

**Human Version:**
"Why aren't we looking at 2008 all over again? Not enough houses, too many buyers. That's it."

**AI Version:**
"This ongoing shortage keeps pushing prices up across the region."

**Human Version:**
"We just don't have enough homes. Hasn't changed in three years, probably won't change next year either."

### Pattern Breaking Examples

**Predictable:** "First, consider location. Second, examine price. Third, evaluate condition."
**Human:** "Location matters, obviously. But here's what really moves the needle: price per square foot compared to the neighborhood average. Condition? That's negotiable."

**Robotic:** "South Jersey home prices continue to demonstrate resilience."
**Human:** "Prices around here? Still holding up pretty well, actually."
