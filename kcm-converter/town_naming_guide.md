5. **Use lesser-mentioned towns for fresh examples:**
   - Wenonah, Pitman, Glassboro, Clayton, Woodstown
   - Bellmawr, Brooklawn, Westville, Barrington
   - Mantua, West Deptford, East Greenwich, Logan

**After mentioning specific towns, rotate through these generic references:**
- "around here"

- [Just continue without geographic reference]

**"South Jersey" Usage:**
