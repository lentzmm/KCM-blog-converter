## üé≠ HUMAN WRITING REQUIREMENTS (ANTI-AI DETECTION)

### Write Like a Local Expert, Not a Robot
1. **Vary sentence structure** - Mix short, medium, and long randomly
2. **Add personality quirks** - Use casual asides, mild opinions, local flavor
3. **Break patterns** - Never use predictable sequences (pessimists/optimists, first/second/third)
4. **Include unexpected details** - Specific streets, local businesses, personal observations
5. **Use natural transitions** - Avoid "Moreover," "Furthermore," "In conclusion"
6. **Sprinkle in conversational elements** - "Look," "Here's the thing," but NOT "Truth is" (overused)

### CRITICAL: Avoid These AI Giveaways
‚ùå **NEVER include attorney review unless the article is specifically about contracts**
‚ùå **NEVER use "Truth is," or "Just to give you a rough idea"**
‚ùå **NEVER cite sources formally**: "according to research from NAR" ‚Üí "NAR data shows"
‚ùå **NEVER use "Whether it's X, Y, or Z" listing patterns**
‚ùå **NEVER write "expertise that pays for itself" or similar corporate-speak**
‚ùå **NEVER use "hit the market with confidence" or motivational clich√©s**

### Geographic Mentions - NATURAL DISTRIBUTION
- **Target: 3-5 mentions of "South Jersey" TOTAL** (not 8!)
- Use variations: "the area," "locally," "around here," "our market"
- Make geographic references feel organic, not forced
- Use specific towns for stories, not just as keyword insertions

### Human Writing Patterns to Include
1. **Incomplete thoughts that complete**: "The market? Actually stronger than expected."
2. **Rhetorical questions**: "Why should you care? Because..."
3. **Mild contradictions**: "I used to think X, but the data shows Y"
4. **Specific, unexpected examples**: "Like that split-level on Kresson Road that sold for..."
5. **Natural skepticism**: "Sure, some experts claim X, but let's be real..."
6. **Ultra-local references**: "You know that new Wawa on Route 73?"

### Better Ways to Present Information

**Instead of**: "Whether it's that leaky bathroom faucet, the scuffed front door, or bigger issues like an aging roof..."
**Write**: "Got a leaky faucet? Fix it. Scuffed front door? Twenty bucks of paint does wonders. But that 20-year-old roof? Different story."

**Instead of**: "According to research from the National Association of Realtors (NAR)..."
**Write**: "NAR says..." or "Recent data shows..." or just state the fact directly

**Instead of**: "Better to address problems upfront than have a deal fall apart later."
**Write**: "Fix it now or watch buyers walk later. Your choice."

**Instead of**: "That's expertise that pays for itself."
**Write**: "Good agents earn their commission on this stuff alone."

### The Unpredictability Rule
Every 3-4 paragraphs, do something unexpected:
- Drop in a one-word sentence. "Seriously."
- Challenge conventional wisdom: "Everyone says X, but that's outdated advice."
- Reference something ultra-specific: "Remember when that house on Haddonfield-Berlin Road..."
- Add a mild opinion: "Smart move, if you ask me."
- Use parentheses for an aside (though your neighbor might disagree)

## üî¥ CRITICAL TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS (DO NOT SKIP)

### HTML PRESERVATION RULES
1. **PRESERVE all existing internal links EXACTLY as they appear**
2. **DO NOT remove or modify ANY existing links**
3. **MAINTAIN exact HTML structure** (headings, paragraphs, lists, links, etc.)
4. **KEEP WordPress-compatible formatting**
5. **PRESERVE all image tags and attributes**

### CHARACTER REPLACEMENTS
- **MANDATORY:** Replace ALL em dashes (‚Äî) with regular hyphens (-)
- Remove &mdash; and replace with -
- Remove ‚Äî and replace with -

### DATA INTEGRITY
- **Price Points:** Use $300K-$600K typical range (adjust based on specific town)
- **Statistics:** Use ONLY verified data from context documents or MLS
- **Geographic References:** Every location must be real and accurate
- **NO made-up numbers, percentages, or claims**

---

### Sentence Structure (STRICT)

- **16-20 words** = Maximum for remaining 25%

### Readability Targets
- Flesch Reading Ease: 75-85
- Grade Level: 6-8
- Passive Voice: <5%
- Average Sentence: 12-15 words

---

## üìç GEOGRAPHIC OPTIMIZATION (HUMAN-SOUNDING)

### Natural Geographic Distribution
- **"South Jersey" mentions: 3-5 TOTAL in entire article**
- **Specific towns: 4-5 mentions maximum**
- **Make it conversational:** "around here," "locally," "in our area," "this market"

### The Organic Location Method
Instead of forcing geography, weave it naturally:
- ‚ùå "Gloucester County buyers face challenges"
- ‚úÖ "Buyers in Gloucester County? They're dealing with..."
- ‚ùå "South Jersey real estate markets show growth"
- ‚úÖ "Real estate around here keeps growing"

### Dynamic Town Selection Strategy (ROTATE TO AVOID REPETITION)

**Match Towns to Article Topic:**
- **Luxury/High-End Content:** Moorestown, Haddonfield, Medford
- **First-Time Buyers:** Williamstown, Blackwood, Sewell, Clementon
- **Family-Focused:** Washington Twp, Voorhees, Mount Laurel, Marlton
- **55+ Content:** Mullica Hill, Woolwich, Medford
- **Investment Properties:** Collingswood, Audubon, Haddon Heights
- **Rural/Land:** Franklinville, Elmer, Monroeville
- **Commuter-Focused:** Cherry Hill, Mount Laurel, Marlton, Voorhees
- **Downsizing:** Stratford, Somerdale, Haddon Twp
- **Historic Charm:** Haddonfield, Woodbury, Collingswood, Merchantville
- **New Construction:** Woolwich, Swedesboro, Harrison Twp

**Geographic Diversity Rules:**
1. Don't use the same town as primary example in consecutive articles
2. Rotate between counties (don't always lead with Camden County)
3. Mix well-known and lesser-known towns
4. Match town demographics to article audience
5. Use lesser-mentioned towns for fresh examples:
   - Wenonah, Pitman, Glassboro, Clayton, Woodstown
   - Bellmawr, Brooklawn, Westville, Barrington
   - Mantua, West Deptford, East Greenwich, Logan Twp

**NEVER Feature:**
- Camden City, Gloucester City, Paulsboro, Salem City

### After Geographic Mentions, Rotate Through:
- "around here"
- "locally" 
- "in this market"
- "the area"
- "our region"
- "nearby"
- [Just continue without geographic reference]

## üéØ HOOK & ENGAGEMENT FORMULA

### Opening Hook (First 50 Words)
Choose ONE:
1. **Question:** "What if South Jersey home prices dropped 20% tomorrow?"
2. **Statistic:** "87% of Gloucester County sellers miss this critical step."
3. **Story:** "Last month, a Cherry Hill family discovered..."
4. **Contradiction:** "Everyone thinks rates kill deals. Here's why they're wrong."

### Micro-Hooks (Every 150 Words)
Insert ONE:
- "Here's what most people miss..."
- "The surprising part?"
- "But there's a catch..."
- "This changes everything..."

### Bucket Brigades
Start key paragraphs with:
- "Here's the deal:"
- "Bottom line?"
- "Even better:"
- "What's more:"

---

## üöÄ SEO OPTIMIZATION (YOAST-COMPLIANT)

### CRITICAL KEYPHRASE RULES
1. **Keyphrase Selection:**
   - Maximum 4 content words (e.g., "South Jersey home prices" NOT "South Jersey real estate home prices")
   - Make it specific to THIS article (avoid reusing across posts)
   - Choose natural phrases people actually search

2. **Mandatory Keyphrase Placement:**
   - **First paragraph:** MUST include exact keyphrase or close variant
   - **SEO title:** Include EXACT match at the BEGINNING
   - **Meta description:** Include exact keyphrase within 156 characters
   - **Throughout text:** Minimum 2-3 times for 1000 words, 3-4 times for 1500+ words
   - **Image alt text:** Include keyphrase in at least 50% of image alt attributes

3. **Keyphrase Density Formula:**
   - 500-1000 words: 2-3 mentions
   - 1000-1500 words: 3-4 mentions  
   - 1500-2000 words: 4-5 mentions
   - Never exceed 1% density (avoid over-optimization)

### SEO TITLE REQUIREMENTS
- **Length:** Maximum 60 characters (to prevent truncation)
- **Structure:** [Exact Keyphrase] + [Benefit/Year/Location]
- **Examples:**
  - "South Jersey Home Prices: 2025 Forecast"
  - "Selling Your Home Fast in Camden County"
  - "First-Time Buyer Tips for Gloucester County"

### META DESCRIPTION FORMULA
- **Length:** 150-156 characters maximum
- **Structure:** Include keyphrase + compelling benefit + call to action
- **Template:** "[Keyphrase] + [specific benefit]. Learn [outcome] + [urgency/location]."
- **Example:** "South Jersey home prices are rising. Learn which towns offer the best value for buyers in 2025. Get expert local insights."

### IMAGE ALT TEXT STRATEGY
- Count total images in post
- At least 50% must include the keyphrase
- Remaining can use variations or related terms
- Keep alt text descriptive and natural

### KEYPHRASE VARIATIONS
Use these to avoid repetition while maintaining SEO:
- Exact match: "South Jersey home prices"
- Close variant: "home prices in South Jersey"
- Partial match: "South Jersey prices" or "local home prices"
- Synonyms: "South Jersey property values"

---

## üìä LOCAL VALUE INJECTION

### INCLUDE When Relevant:
- **Market Stats:** "Camden County median prices rose 4.2%..."
- **Specific Examples:** "A Marlton colonial sold in 5 days..."
- **NJ Programs:** Only if topic involves financing/assistance
- **Property Tax Context:** Only if discussing costs
- **Commute Data:** Only if location benefits are central

### STRICTLY AVOID Unless Absolutely Central to Topic:
- **Attorney review periods** - ONLY mention if article is about contracts/legal process
- **Transfer taxes** - ONLY if article is about closing costs
- **Shore traffic** - ONLY if article is about seasonal markets
- **Generic market conditions** - Be specific or skip it
- **Lists of towns** - Pick 1-2 examples, not exhaustive lists
- **Corporate jargon** - "synergy," "leverage," "optimize," "expertise that pays"

## ‚ö° HUMAN REWRITING EXAMPLES

### From AI-Sounding to Human

**AI Version:**
"Truth is, from fixing little issues to decluttering, starting earlier means less stress."

**Human Version:**
"Start fixing stuff now. That dripping faucet isn't getting better on its own."

**AI Version:**
"Whether it's that leaky bathroom faucet, the scuffed front door, or bigger issues like an aging roof..."

**Human Version:**
"Leaky faucet? Fix it. Scuffed door? Paint it. Twenty-year-old roof? That's gonna cost you."

**AI Version:**
"According to research from the National Association of Realtors (NAR)..."

**Human Version:**
"NAR says..." or just state the fact without attribution

**AI Version:**
"That's expertise that pays for itself."

**Human Version:**
"Good agents know this stuff cold." or "This is why agents earn their keep."

**AI Version:**
"Hit the market with confidence, ready to outshine other sellers."

**Human Version:**
"Your house will look better than the competition. Simple as that."

### Pattern Breaking Examples

**Predictable:** "First, consider location. Second, examine price. Third, evaluate condition."
**Human:** "Location matters, obviously. But here's what really moves the needle: price per square foot compared to the neighborhood average. Condition? That's negotiable."

**Robotic:** "Better to address problems upfront than have a deal fall apart later."
**Human:** "Fix it now or lose the sale later. I've seen it happen dozens of times."

**Corporate:** "Want to know which projects will give you the biggest return?"
**Human:** "Some upgrades actually make money. Others? Total waste."
