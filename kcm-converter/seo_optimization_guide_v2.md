## üéØ KEYPHRASE FUNDAMENTALS

### Rule 1: Keyphrase Selection

**Maximum Length:** 4 content words
- ‚úÖ "South Jersey home prices"
- ‚úÖ "selling tips Camden County"
- ‚ùå "South Jersey real estate home prices forecast" (too long)

**Make It Specific:** Unique to THIS article
- ‚úÖ "Voorhees home values 2025"
- ‚ùå "real estate market" (too generic, reused across posts)

**Choose Natural Phrases:** What people actually search
- ‚úÖ "first time buyer mistakes"
- ‚úÖ "home staging tips"
- ‚ùå "residential property acquisition methodology"

### Rule 2: One Keyphrase Per Article
Never try to optimize for multiple keyphrases. Pick ONE and use it consistently.

---

## üìç MANDATORY KEYPHRASE PLACEMENT

### 1. First Paragraph (CRITICAL)
**Requirement:** Exact keyphrase or close variant in opening paragraph

**Examples:**

‚úÖ **EXACT MATCH:**
"South Jersey home prices continue their upward trend..."

‚úÖ **CLOSE VARIANT:**
"Home prices in South Jersey show no signs of slowing..."

‚úÖ **PARTIAL MATCH:**
"Wondering about home prices around here? South Jersey keeps defying predictions..."

‚ùå **MISSING:**
"The real estate market continues to surprise experts..." (no keyphrase in first paragraph)

### 2. SEO Title (CRITICAL)
**Requirement:** Exact keyphrase at the BEGINNING of title

**Length:** Maximum 60 characters (to prevent truncation in search results)

**Formula:** [Exact Keyphrase] + [Benefit/Year/Location]

**Examples:**

‚úÖ "South Jersey Home Prices: 2025 Forecast" (52 chars)  
‚úÖ "Selling Your Home Fast: Camden County Tips" (44 chars)  
‚úÖ "First-Time Buyer Guide for Gloucester County" (46 chars)

‚ùå "Everything You Need to Know About South Jersey Home Prices" (60+ chars, keyphrase not at beginning)  
‚ùå "2025 Forecast for South Jersey Home Prices" (keyphrase not at beginning)

### 3. Meta Description (CRITICAL)
**Requirements:**
- Length: 150-156 characters maximum
- Include exact keyphrase
- Compelling benefit
- Natural call to action

**Formula:** [Keyphrase] + [specific benefit]. [Outcome] + [urgency/location].

**Examples:**

‚úÖ "South Jersey home prices are rising. Learn which towns offer the best value for buyers in 2025. Get expert local insights." (123 chars)

‚úÖ "Selling your home in Camden County? Discover the 5 staging tips that help homes sell 30% faster. Start today." (111 chars)

‚ùå "This article discusses various aspects of the real estate market and provides information about pricing trends in the region." (125 chars - no keyphrase, generic, boring)

### 4. Throughout Body Text
**Density Requirements:**

| Article Length | Keyphrase Mentions |
|---------------|-------------------|
| 500-1000 words | 2-3 times |
| 1000-1500 words | 3-4 times |
| 1500-2000 words | 4-5 times |

**Maximum Density:** Never exceed 1% (avoid over-optimization)

**Distribution:** Spread naturally throughout article
- First paragraph: Required
- Middle sections: 1-2 mentions
- Conclusion: Optional mention

### 5. Image Alt Text (50%+ Images)
**Requirement:** At least 50% of images must include exact keyphrase

**If article has 4 images:**
- 2 images: Include exact keyphrase
- 2 images: Use variations or related terms

**Examples:**

‚úÖ "Graph showing South Jersey home prices from 2020-2025"  
‚úÖ "Modern kitchen in South Jersey home"  
‚úÖ "Real estate agent discussing home prices with clients"  
‚úÖ "Neighborhood street view in Cherry Hill"

---

## üî§ KEYPHRASE VARIATIONS

Use these to maintain readability while hitting SEO targets:

### Exact Match
"South Jersey home prices"

### Close Variant
"home prices in South Jersey"

### Partial Match
"South Jersey prices" or "local home prices"

### Synonyms
"South Jersey property values"  
"South Jersey real estate costs"

**When to Use Each:**

- **First paragraph:** Exact match or close variant
- **SEO title:** Exact match
- **Meta description:** Exact match
- **Body text:** Mix of exact, close, and partial
- **Image alt text:** Exact in 50%+, variations in remainder

---

## üìè LENGTH REQUIREMENTS

### SEO Title
- **Minimum:** 50 characters
- **Maximum:** 60 characters
- **Ideal:** 52-58 characters

**Why:** Google truncates titles over 60 characters with "..."

**Check Your Length:**
Count characters including spaces. "South Jersey Home Prices: 2025" = 31 characters.

### Meta Description
- **Minimum:** 120 characters
- **Maximum:** 156 characters
- **Ideal:** 150-155 characters

**Why:** Google truncates descriptions over 156 characters.

**What Happens If Too Short:**
Google generates its own description from page content (you lose control).

---

## üñºÔ∏è IMAGE ALT TEXT STRATEGY

### Step 1: Count Total Images
Example: Article has 6 images

### Step 2: Calculate 50% Minimum
6 images √ó 50% = 3 images must include keyphrase

### Step 3: Assign Keyphrase Usage
- **Image 1:** "Chart showing South Jersey home prices 2020-2025" ‚úÖ
- **Image 2:** "Modern kitchen renovation in local home" ‚ùå
- **Image 3:** "Real estate agent discussing South Jersey home prices" ‚úÖ
- **Image 4:** "For sale sign in front of colonial house" ‚ùå
- **Image 5:** "Couple reviewing home prices at closing table" ‚úÖ
- **Image 6:** "Neighborhood street in Moorestown" ‚ùå

**Result:** 3 of 6 images include keyphrase = 50% ‚úÖ

### Alt Text Best Practices
- Keep descriptive (what's actually in the image)
- Natural language (not keyword stuffing)
- 125 characters or less
- Include keyphrase where it makes sense

‚ùå **KEYWORD STUFFING:**
"South Jersey home prices South Jersey home prices graph South Jersey home prices data"

‚úÖ **NATURAL:**
"Bar graph comparing South Jersey home prices from 2020 to 2025"

---

## üìä KEYPHRASE DENSITY CALCULATOR

**Formula:** (Number of keyphrase mentions √∑ Total word count) √ó 100 = Density %

**Example:**
- Article: 1,200 words
- Keyphrase mentions: 4 times
- Calculation: (4 √∑ 1,200) √ó 100 = 0.33%

**Target:** 0.5% - 1.0%

**Red Flags:**
- Under 0.3%: Too few mentions (won't rank)
- Over 1.0%: Keyword stuffing (penalty risk)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è COMMON SEO MISTAKES TO AVOID

### 1. Keyword Stuffing
‚ùå "South Jersey home prices are rising. These South Jersey home prices reflect market trends. Understanding South Jersey home prices is important."

‚úÖ "Home prices in South Jersey are rising. This reflects broader market trends. Understanding local pricing helps buyers make smart decisions."

### 2. Duplicate Keyphrases
Don't use the same keyphrase across multiple articles. Each post needs a unique keyphrase.

### 3. Ignoring User Intent
Match your keyphrase to what the article actually delivers.

‚ùå Title: "South Jersey Home Prices"  
Content: Generic tips about buying homes

‚úÖ Title: "South Jersey Home Prices: 2025 Forecast"  
Content: Actual price data, predictions, market analysis

### 4. Forgetting Mobile
Titles over 60 characters get cut off even more on mobile. Keep it tight.

### 5. Generic Meta Descriptions
Make it compelling. This is your ad in search results.

‚ùå "This article talks about home prices in South Jersey and provides information about the market."

‚úÖ "South Jersey home prices jumped 12% in 2024. Discover which towns offer the best value and what 2025 holds for buyers."

## üöÄ REMEMBER

SEO isn't about tricking Google. It's about making your content easy to find, easy to read, and valuable to users.

Follow these rules, but never sacrifice readability for SEO. If it sounds weird with the keyphrase jammed in, rewrite it naturally.
