# Yoast SEO Guidelines for WordPress Posts

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive Yoast SEO best practices for the KCM Blog Converter.
All generated WordPress posts must adhere to these guidelines for optimal SEO performance.

---

## 1. Focus Keyphrase

### Requirements
- **Length**: 3-6 words
- **Location specificity**: MUST include "South Jersey" or specific town name
- **Topic relevance**: Should match the primary topic of the article

### Examples
- ✅ "South Jersey home equity"
- ✅ "Cherry Hill real estate market"
- ✅ "first time buyers South Jersey"
- ❌ "home equity" (too generic, no location)
- ❌ "real estate market in South Jersey for first time home buyers in 2025" (too long)

### Usage in Content
- **50%+ of images**: Must include exact focus keyphrase in alt text
- **Remaining images**: Use variations or descriptive text
- **Title**: Include focus keyphrase naturally
- **First paragraph**: Include focus keyphrase within first 100 words
- **Subheadings**: Include variations of keyphrase in 2-3 H2/H3 tags

---

## 2. SEO Title

### Requirements
- **Length**: 50-60 characters (strict limit)
- **Format**: `[Main Topic] | [Location] | [Brand/Year]`
- **Include**: Focus keyphrase or close variation
- **Avoid**: Current year references that will become outdated

### Examples
- ✅ "Home Equity Guide | South Jersey | Mike Sells NJ" (52 chars)
- ✅ "Cherry Hill Real Estate Market Trends" (39 chars)
- ❌ "Everything You Need to Know About Home Equity in South Jersey in 2025" (70 chars - too long)
- ❌ "Home Equity" (11 chars - too short, missing location)

---

## 3. Meta Description

### Requirements
- **Length**: 140-160 characters (optimal for Google display)
- **Include**: Focus keyphrase naturally
- **Include**: Call-to-action or value proposition
- **Avoid**: Keyword stuffing

### Default Template
If custom meta description is not needed, use:
```
%%title%% %%sep%% %%sitename%% %%sep%% %%primary_category%%
```

This auto-generates based on WordPress fields.

### Custom Examples
- ✅ "Discover how South Jersey homeowners can leverage home equity for financial goals. Expert local guidance from Mike Sells NJ." (134 chars)
- ✅ "Cherry Hill real estate market analysis: pricing trends, inventory levels, and buyer opportunities in Gloucester County." (124 chars)
- ❌ "Home equity, South Jersey home equity, equity loans, home equity South Jersey, real estate equity..." (keyword stuffing)

---

## 4. Categories

### Available Categories
- For Buyers
- For Sellers
- Housing Market Updates
- Burlington County Real Estate
- Camden County Real Estate
- Cumberland County Real Estate
- Gloucester County Real Estate
- Salem County Real Estate

### Selection Guidelines
- **Minimum**: 1 category
- **Maximum**: 3 categories
- **Primary category**: Should be the main topic (For Buyers, For Sellers, or Housing Market Updates)
- **County category**: Add ONLY if specific county/towns are heavily featured (mentioned 3+ times)

### Examples
- First-time buyer article mentioning Cherry Hill → `["For Buyers", "Camden County Real Estate"]`
- Market trends article (general South Jersey) → `["Housing Market Updates"]`
- Selling tips for Gloucester County → `["For Sellers", "Gloucester County Real Estate"]`

---

## 5. Tags

### Requirements
- **Minimum**: 5 tags
- **Maximum**: 10 tags
- **MUST use existing tags only** - do NOT create new tags
- **NO date tags** - these are auto-generated by WordPress

### Tag Categories

#### Topic Tags (Choose 3-5 based on content)
- Home Prices
- Interest Rates
- Equity
- Mortgage
- Down Payments
- Affordability
- Home Value
- Pricing Strategy
- Home Staging
- Inspection
- Forecasts
- Real Estate Market
- Spring Market
- Summer Market
- Economy

#### Demographic Tags (Choose 1-2 if relevant)

- Burlington Twp, Cinnaminson, Delran, Moorestown
- Bridgeton, Vineland, Millville, Commercial Twp, Deerfield
- Salem, Pennsville, Carneys Point, Alloway, Elmer

---

## 6. Town Randomization Rules

### The Problem
- ❌ Cherry Hill and Washington Twp appear in EVERY post (not randomized)
- ❌ This creates word stuffing and repetitive content

### The Solution

#### Prompt Instructions
When generating localized content:

1. **Randomize town selection** from available South Jersey towns
2. **Limit mentions**: Maximum 4-5 towns per article
3. **Use variety**: Don't use the same towns in consecutive articles
4. **Match context**: Choose towns appropriate to the topic
   - High-price topics → Haddonfield, Moorestown, Cherry Hill
   - Starter homes → Mount Laurel, Deptford, Clayton
   - Rural/affordable → Gloucester County towns (Mullica Hill, Pitman)

#### Tagging Rules
- **ONLY tag towns that are mentioned** in the article text
- If Cherry Hill is mentioned → tag it
- If Cherry Hill is NOT mentioned → do NOT tag it
- Count mentions: Town must appear at least 2 times to warrant a tag

### Example Implementation
```
Article mentions: Haddonfield (3x), Moorestown (2x), Washington Twp (1x)
✅ Tags: Haddonfield, Moorestown
❌ Tags: Washington Twp (only mentioned once)
```

---

## 7. Image Alt Text Requirements

### Yoast Recommendations
- **50%+ of images**: Must include exact focus keyphrase
- **Remaining images**: Use variations or descriptive text
- **Length**: 125 characters or less
- **Natural language**: Should sound human, not robotic

### Format
- Images 1, 3, 5, 7... (odd): Include exact focus keyphrase
- Images 2, 4, 6, 8... (even): Use variations or descriptions

### Examples

**Focus Keyphrase**: "South Jersey home equity"

**Image 1 (odd - exact keyphrase)**:
```
South Jersey home equity: Guide to leveraging property value
```

**Image 2 (even - variation)**:
```
Understanding equity options for Gloucester County homeowners
```

**Image 3 (odd - exact keyphrase)**:
```
South Jersey home equity - infographic on loan types
```

**Image 4 (even - descriptive)**:
```
Cherry Hill homeowner reviewing home equity line of credit options
```

---

## 8. Sentence Length Requirements (CRITICAL)

### Yoast Requirement: Maximum 25% of Sentences Over 20 Words

**Rule:** No more than 25% of sentences should exceed 20 words.

### Current Issue
If Yoast reports **"31.7% of the sentences contain more than 20 words"**, this means the content violates the readability standard and must be corrected.

### Why This Matters
- **Readability**: Long sentences are harder to understand and reduce engagement
- **SEO**: Google favors content that's easy to read and scan
- **User Experience**: Shorter sentences keep readers engaged
- **Yoast Scoring**: Violations trigger orange/red warnings affecting overall SEO score

### The Target Formula

**Ideal Distribution:**
- **75% of sentences**: 10-15 words
- **20% of sentences**: 16-20 words
- **5% of sentences**: 21-25 words (absolute maximum)
- **0% of sentences**: 26+ words (FORBIDDEN - rewrite immediately)

### Step-by-Step Fix

**Step 1: Identify Long Sentences**
- Count words in each sentence
- Flag any sentence with 21+ words
- Target: Reduce to 20 words or less

**Step 2: Break Into Multiple Sentences**
Most long sentences can be split at natural breaks:
- Conjunctions (and, but, or, so)
- Dependent clauses (which, that, because, since)
- List items

**Step 3: Eliminate Filler Words**
Remove unnecessary words that add length without value:
- "in order to" → "to"
- "due to the fact that" → "because"
- "at this point in time" → "now"
- "it is important to note that" → [delete entirely]

### Examples

**❌ VIOLATION (32 words):**
```
While many factors contribute to the overall health of the real estate market in South Jersey, supply and demand dynamics remain the primary driver of price trends across all counties in the region.
```

**✅ COMPLIANT (3 sentences, average 11 words each):**
```
What drives home prices in South Jersey? Supply and demand. When inventory stays low and buyers keep competing, prices go up.
```

**❌ VIOLATION (28 words):**
```
According to recent data from the National Association of Realtors, homes that are professionally staged tend to sell faster and for higher prices than comparable unstaged properties.
```

**✅ COMPLIANT (2 sentences, 14 and 10 words):**
```
NAR data shows professionally staged homes sell faster and for more money. The difference can be significant compared to unstaged properties.
```

**❌ VIOLATION (35 words):**
```
If you're considering selling your home in the near future, it's important to note that preparing your property in advance by addressing minor repairs and improving curb appeal can make a substantial difference in both the sale price and time on market.
```

**✅ COMPLIANT (4 sentences, average 12 words each):**
```
Thinking about selling soon? Start preparing now. Fix minor repairs and improve curb appeal. These simple steps can boost your sale price and reduce time on market.
```

### Techniques for Shortening Sentences

**Technique 1: Split at Conjunctions**

❌ "Rates are rising and inventory is falling, but buyer demand remains strong."
✅ "Rates are rising. Inventory is falling. But buyer demand remains strong."

**Technique 2: Remove Introductory Phrases**

❌ "It's important to note that home prices in Cherry Hill increased 8% last year."
✅ "Cherry Hill home prices increased 8% last year."

**Technique 3: Convert Clauses to Sentences**

❌ "Homes that are priced correctly from the start tend to sell faster, which saves sellers money on carrying costs."
✅ "Price correctly from the start. You'll sell faster and save on carrying costs."

**Technique 4: Use Active Voice**

❌ "The house was purchased by a family from Philadelphia after multiple offers were received."
✅ "A Philadelphia family bought the house. We received multiple offers."

**Technique 5: Cut Redundancy**

❌ "In the current market conditions we're seeing today, buyers need to act quickly and fast."
✅ "Buyers need to act fast."

### Common Long Sentence Patterns to Avoid

**Pattern 1: Multiple Clauses with Commas**
❌ "When inventory is low, and buyer demand is high, and rates remain stable, prices tend to climb."
✅ "Low inventory plus high demand equals rising prices. Especially when rates stay stable."

**Pattern 2: "Because/Since" Dependencies**
❌ "Since mortgage rates have increased significantly over the past year, many buyers are reconsidering their budgets."
✅ "Mortgage rates jumped over the past year. Many buyers are reconsidering their budgets."

**Pattern 3: Lists Within Sentences**
❌ "Staging involves decluttering, depersonalizing, making minor repairs, and ensuring every room shows well."
✅ "Staging has four key steps. Declutter. Depersonalize. Fix minor issues. Make every room shine."

**Pattern 4: According to [Source] Constructions**
❌ "According to recent research from the National Association of Realtors published in their quarterly report..."
✅ "NAR's latest report shows..." or just state the fact directly.

### Word Count Reference

To help visualize 20-word limit:

**Exactly 20 words:**
"Home prices in South Jersey continue to rise despite higher interest rates, driven primarily by low inventory levels and strong buyer demand across the region."

**Shortened to 15 words:**
"South Jersey home prices keep rising. Low inventory and strong demand outweigh higher interest rates."

### Measuring Sentence Length

**Manual Count:**
- Copy content into a word processor
- Use readability statistics feature
- Check "words per sentence" average
- Target: 12-15 words per sentence average

**Yoast Plugin:**
- Automatically flags sentences over 20 words
- Shows percentage exceeding recommendation
- Target: Green light (≤25% over 20 words)

### Quality Control Checklist

Before finalizing content:

- [ ] Count words in each sentence
- [ ] Flag all sentences with 21+ words
- [ ] Rewrite flagged sentences (split or trim)
- [ ] Verify no sentence exceeds 25 words (absolute max)
- [ ] Check Yoast readability: ≤25% over 20 words
- [ ] Maintain meaning and flow while shortening
- [ ] Read aloud to ensure natural rhythm

## 9. Subheading Distribution Requirements

### The 300-Word Rule (CRITICAL)

**Yoast Requirement:** No section of text should exceed 300 words without a subheading (H2 or H3).

### Why This Matters
- **Readability**: Long text blocks are hard to scan and overwhelming to readers
- **SEO**: Google favors well-structured content with clear hierarchy
- **User Experience**: Subheadings help readers find specific information quickly
- **Yoast Scoring**: Violations trigger red/orange warnings in Yoast SEO plugin

### Implementation Guidelines

**Step 1: Calculate Section Length**
- Count words between each H2/H3 heading
- Include all paragraph text, lists, and quotes
- Do NOT include heading text itself in count

**Step 2: Add Subheadings Where Needed**
- If any section exceeds 300 words → add H2 or H3 subheading
- Place subheading at natural topic break (not mid-thought)
- Ensure subheading is descriptive and relevant

**Step 3: Maintain Hierarchy**
- Main sections: H2 (larger topics)
- Subsections within H2: H3 (supporting points)
- Never skip levels (H2 → H4 ❌)

### Examples

**❌ VIOLATION (450 words without subheading):**
```html
<h2>Understanding Home Equity</h2>
<p>Home equity is the difference between... [450 words of continuous text]</p>
```

**✅ COMPLIANT (sections under 300 words):**
```html
<h2>Understanding Home Equity</h2>
<p>Home equity is the difference between... [200 words]</p>

<h3>How to Calculate Your Equity</h3>
<p>The calculation is straightforward... [150 words]</p>

<h3>Factors That Affect Equity</h3>
<p>Several factors influence... [200 words]</p>
```

### Keyphrase Integration in Subheadings

**Requirement:** Include keyphrase variations in 2-3 H2/H3 tags

**Example - Focus Keyphrase: "South Jersey home equity"**

✅ **Good subheading distribution:**
- H2: "Understanding Home Equity in South Jersey" (keyphrase variation ✓)
- H3: "How to Calculate Your Equity" (no keyphrase)
- H2: "South Jersey Home Equity Options for Homeowners" (keyphrase ✓)
- H3: "Equity Loans vs. Lines of Credit" (no keyphrase)
- H2: "Maximizing Your Property Value" (no keyphrase)

**Result:** 2 of 5 subheadings include keyphrase = COMPLIANT ✓

### Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Too Many Subheadings**
- Don't add H2/H3 every 100 words (feels choppy)
- Target: 200-300 words per section (optimal range)

**Mistake 2: Generic Subheadings**
❌ "More Information"
❌ "Additional Details"
✅ "Common Equity Loan Mistakes to Avoid"
✅ "South Jersey Market Trends"

**Mistake 3: Keyword Stuffing in Headings**
❌ "South Jersey Home Equity South Jersey"
❌ "Home Equity Home Equity Home Equity"
✅ "Leveraging Your Home Equity in South Jersey"
