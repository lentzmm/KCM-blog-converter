# Yoast SEO Guidelines for WordPress Posts

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive Yoast SEO best practices for the KCM Blog Converter.
All generated WordPress posts must adhere to these guidelines for optimal SEO performance.

---

## 1. Focus Keyphrase

### Requirements
- **Length**: 3-6 words
- **Location specificity**: MUST include "South Jersey" or specific town name
- **Topic relevance**: Should match the primary topic of the article

### Examples
- ✅ "South Jersey home equity"
- ✅ "Cherry Hill real estate market"
- ✅ "first time buyers South Jersey"
- ❌ "home equity" (too generic, no location)
- ❌ "real estate market in South Jersey for first time home buyers in 2025" (too long)

### Usage in Content
- **50%+ of images**: Must include exact focus keyphrase in alt text
- **Remaining images**: Use variations or descriptive text
- **Title**: Include focus keyphrase naturally
- **First paragraph**: Include focus keyphrase within first 100 words
- **Subheadings**: Include variations of keyphrase in 2-3 H2/H3 tags

---

## 2. SEO Title

### Requirements
- **Length**: 50-60 characters (strict limit)
- **Format**: `[Main Topic] | [Location] | [Brand/Year]`
- **Include**: Focus keyphrase or close variation
- **Avoid**: Current year references that will become outdated

### Examples
- ✅ "Home Equity Guide | South Jersey | Mike Sells NJ" (52 chars)
- ✅ "Cherry Hill Real Estate Market Trends" (39 chars)
- ❌ "Everything You Need to Know About Home Equity in South Jersey in 2025" (70 chars - too long)
- ❌ "Home Equity" (11 chars - too short, missing location)

---

## 3. Meta Description

### Requirements
- **Length**: 140-160 characters (optimal for Google display)
- **Include**: Focus keyphrase naturally
- **Include**: Call-to-action or value proposition
- **Avoid**: Keyword stuffing

### Default Template
If custom meta description is not needed, use:
```
%%title%% %%sep%% %%sitename%% %%sep%% %%primary_category%%
```

This auto-generates based on WordPress fields.

### Custom Examples
- ✅ "Discover how South Jersey homeowners can leverage home equity for financial goals. Expert local guidance from Mike Sells NJ." (134 chars)
- ✅ "Cherry Hill real estate market analysis: pricing trends, inventory levels, and buyer opportunities in Gloucester County." (124 chars)
- ❌ "Home equity, South Jersey home equity, equity loans, home equity South Jersey, real estate equity..." (keyword stuffing)

---

## 4. Categories

### Available Categories
- For Buyers
- For Sellers
- Housing Market Updates
- Burlington County Real Estate
- Camden County Real Estate
- Cumberland County Real Estate
- Gloucester County Real Estate
- Salem County Real Estate

### Selection Guidelines
- **Minimum**: 1 category
- **Maximum**: 3 categories
- **Primary category**: Should be the main topic (For Buyers, For Sellers, or Housing Market Updates)
- **County category**: Add ONLY if specific county/towns are heavily featured (mentioned 3+ times)

### Examples
- First-time buyer article mentioning Cherry Hill → `["For Buyers", "Camden County Real Estate"]`
- Market trends article (general South Jersey) → `["Housing Market Updates"]`
- Selling tips for Gloucester County → `["For Sellers", "Gloucester County Real Estate"]`

---

## 5. Tags

### Requirements
- **Minimum**: 5 tags
- **Maximum**: 10 tags
- **MUST use existing tags only** - do NOT create new tags
- **NO date tags** - these are auto-generated by WordPress

### Tag Categories

#### Topic Tags (Choose 3-5 based on content)
- Home Prices
- Interest Rates
- Equity
- Mortgage
- Down Payments
- Affordability
- Home Value
- Pricing Strategy
- Home Staging
- Inspection
- Forecasts

## 6. Town Randomization Rules

### The Problem
- ❌ Cherry Hill and Washington Twp appear in EVERY post (not randomized)
- ❌ This creates word stuffing and repetitive content

### The Solution

#### Prompt Instructions
When generating localized content:

1. **Randomize town selection** from available South Jersey towns
2. **Limit mentions**: Maximum 4-5 towns per article
3. **Use variety**: Don't use the same towns in consecutive articles
4. **Match context**: Choose towns appropriate to the topic
   - High-price topics → Haddonfield, Moorestown, Cherry Hill
   - Starter homes → Mount Laurel, Deptford, Clayton
   - Rural/affordable → Gloucester County towns (Mullica Hill, Pitman)

#### Tagging Rules
- **ONLY tag towns that are mentioned** in the article text
- If Cherry Hill is mentioned → tag it
- If Cherry Hill is NOT mentioned → do NOT tag it
- Count mentions: Town must appear at least 2 times to warrant a tag

### Example Implementation
```
Article mentions: Haddonfield (3x), Moorestown (2x), Washington Twp (1x)
✅ Tags: Haddonfield, Moorestown
❌ Tags: Washington Twp (only mentioned once)
```

## 7. Image Alt Text Requirements

### Yoast Recommendations
- **50%+ of images**: Must include exact focus keyphrase
- **Remaining images**: Use variations or descriptive text
- **Length**: 125 characters or less
- **Natural language**: Should sound human, not robotic

### Format
- Images 1, 3, 5, 7... (odd): Include exact focus keyphrase
- Images 2, 4, 6, 8... (even): Use variations or descriptions

### Examples

**Focus Keyphrase**: "South Jersey home equity"

**Image 1 (odd - exact keyphrase)**:
```
South Jersey home equity: Guide to leveraging property value
```

**Image 2 (even - variation)**:
```
Understanding equity options for Gloucester County homeowners
```

**Image 3 (odd - exact keyphrase)**:
```
South Jersey home equity - infographic on loan types
```

**Image 4 (even - descriptive)**:
```
Cherry Hill homeowner reviewing home equity line of credit options
```
