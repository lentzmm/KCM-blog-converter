## üî¥ CRITICAL: HTML PRESERVATION RULES

### Rule 1: Preserve ALL Existing Internal Links
**NEVER modify, remove, or change ANY existing links**

‚úÖ **CORRECT:**
Keep this exactly as-is:
```html
<a href="https://www.keepingcurrentmatters.com/original-article/">Learn more</a>
```

‚ùå **WRONG:**
DO NOT change to:
```html
<a href="https://yoursite.com/new-link/">Learn more</a>
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Breaks user experience
- Violates content agreement
- Can break tracking/analytics
- May violate attribution requirements

### Rule 2: Maintain Exact HTML Structure
Preserve all HTML elements exactly:
- Heading tags (h1, h2, h3, etc.)
- Paragraph tags (p)
- List structures (ul, ol, li)
- Image tags (img)
- Emphasis tags (strong, em)
- Link tags (a)

‚úÖ **CORRECT:**
```html
<h2>Market Trends</h2>
<p>Home prices continue to rise.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Inventory remains low</li>
  <li>Demand stays high</li>
</ul>
```

‚ùå **WRONG:**
```html
**Market Trends**
Home prices continue to rise.
* Inventory remains low
* Demand stays high
```

### Rule 3: Keep WordPress-Compatible Formatting
All HTML must work in WordPress editor:
- No custom CSS inline (unless already present)
- No JavaScript
- Standard HTML tags only
- Proper nesting maintained

### Rule 4: Preserve All Image Tags and Attributes
Keep every image exactly as provided:

‚úÖ **CORRECT:**
```html
<img src="https://kcm-cdn.com/image123.jpg" alt="Market graph" width="800" height="600" />
```

‚ùå **WRONG:**
- Removing images
- Changing src URLs
- Removing width/height attributes
- Removing existing alt text

**Note:** You CAN update alt text to include keyphrases if original alt text exists and updating it improves SEO.

## ‚ö° CHARACTER REPLACEMENTS (MANDATORY)

### Em Dashes Must Be Replaced
Replace ALL variations of em dashes with regular hyphens.

**Find and Replace:**

| Character | Replace With |
|-----------|-------------|
| ‚Äî (em dash) | - (hyphen) |
| &mdash; | - (hyphen) |
| ‚Äì (en dash) | - (hyphen) |
| &ndash; | - (hyphen) |

**Examples:**

‚ùå **BEFORE:**
"Prices rose ‚Äî up 12% from last year ‚Äî and show no signs of slowing."

‚úÖ **AFTER:**
"Prices rose - up 12% from last year - and show no signs of slowing."

‚ùå **BEFORE:**
"The market&mdash;especially in South Jersey&mdash;remains strong."

‚úÖ **AFTER:**
"The market - especially in South Jersey - remains strong."

**Why This Matters:**
- Em dashes don't always render correctly in WordPress
- Can cause encoding issues
- Creates inconsistent formatting
- May break on mobile devices

### Other Character Considerations

**Smart Quotes (Generally Fine):**
- " and " (curly quotes) ‚Üí Usually okay
- ' and ' (curly apostrophes) ‚Üí Usually okay

**Special Characters (Keep As-Is):**
- ¬© (copyright symbol)
- ¬Æ (registered trademark)
- ‚Ñ¢ (trademark)
- $ (dollar sign)
- % (percent sign)

**Ampersands:**
- & in body text ‚Üí Usually okay
- &amp; in HTML ‚Üí Keep as-is

## üìä DATA INTEGRITY REQUIREMENTS

### Rule 1: Price Points Must Be Accurate
**South Jersey Typical Range:** $300K - $600K

**Adjust based on specific town:**

| Town Tier | Typical Range |
|-----------|--------------|
| Luxury (Moorestown, Haddonfield) | $450K - $850K |
| Mid-Range (Cherry Hill, Voorhees) | $350K - $550K |
| Entry-Level (Williamstown, Sewell) | $250K - $400K |
| Rural (Franklinville, Elmer) | $200K - $350K |

**When Using Price Examples:**
- Must align with town mentioned
- Must align with context documents
- Never make up specific prices
- Use ranges when exact data unavailable

‚úÖ **CORRECT:**
"A typical Moorestown colonial ranges from $500K to $700K."

‚ùå **WRONG:**
"That Moorestown colonial sold for $892,450." (too specific without verification)

### Rule 2: Statistics Must Be Verified
**ONLY use statistics from:**
1. Context documents provided
2. Official MLS data
3. NAR/CAR reports (if cited in context)
4. Government sources (if cited in context)

**NEVER:**
- Make up percentages
- Estimate growth rates
- Invent market statistics
- Extrapolate beyond data

‚úÖ **CORRECT:**
"Camden County median prices rose 4.2% year-over-year, according to MLS data."
(Only if this stat is in context documents)

‚ùå **WRONG:**
"Experts predict 8% growth next year."
(Unless this prediction is in context documents)

### Rule 3: Geographic References Must Be Real
**Every location must be:**
- A real South Jersey municipality
- Named correctly per Town Naming Guide
- Actually in the region mentioned
- Consistent throughout article

‚úÖ **CORRECT:**
"Homes in Washington Twp sell quickly."
"That Kresson Road property sold in three days."

‚ùå **WRONG:**
"Homes in Springfield Township sell quickly."
(There are multiple Springfield Townships in NJ - which one?)

"That property on Main Street sold fast."
(Every town has a Main Street - be specific)

### Rule 4: No Fabricated Examples
**Never create fictional scenarios without clear signals:**

‚ùå **WRONG:**
"Last Tuesday, a Voorhees split-level sold for $487,000 in two days with three offers."
(Too specific to be made up)

‚úÖ **CORRECT:**
"Split-levels in Voorhees typically sell within a week when priced right."
(General statement, not specific fabrication)

‚úÖ **ALSO CORRECT:**
"Imagine this: You list your Voorhees split-level Friday morning. By Monday, you have three offers."
(Clearly hypothetical with 'imagine')

```

‚ùå **WRONG:**
```html
<h1>Title</h1>
<h3>Section</h3>  <!-- Skipped h2 -->
<h2>Later Section</h2>  <!-- Goes backward -->
```

### Paragraph Structure

‚úÖ **CORRECT:**
```html

  <li>Third point</li>
</ul>
```

‚ùå **WRONG:**

- Third point</p>
```

### Link Structure
