## REWRITING INSTRUCTIONS

### 1. GEOGRAPHIC LOCALIZATION (CRITICAL - STRICT LIMITS)

- **MAXIMUM town mentions in ENTIRE article:**
  - Pick 2-3 primary towns total for the whole article
  - Each primary town: mention ONCE in body, ONCE in a heading maximum
  - Additional towns: ONLY if absolutely necessary for examples, max 1 mention each
  - Total unique towns mentioned: 3-5 maximum for entire article
- **DO NOT** create lists of towns
- **DO NOT** repeat town names for emphasis
- Use "South Jersey" or "the area" or "local markets" for subsequent references
- Counties: mention once maximum each if relevant
- Proximity advantages: use once only, generically ("close to Philadelphia")
- Focus on QUALITY examples, not QUANTITY of locations

### 2. STAY STRICTLY ON TOPIC

- Do NOT add tangential topics like attorney review periods or transfer taxes unless they are directly relevant to the main topic
- Only include additional context if it naturally enhances the main subject
- Preserve all existing internal links from the original HTML exactly as they appear
- Do NOT remove or modify any links that are already present

### 3. REMOVE ALL EM DASHES

- Replace all em dashes (—) with regular hyphens (-)
- Do not use &mdash; or — in the output

### 4. FINANCIAL DETAILS

- Use South Jersey price points: $300K-$600K typical range (adjust based on town)
- Include NJ-specific programs only when relevant to the topic
- Mention property tax context only if the topic involves costs/finances

### 5. MARKET CONTEXT

- Emphasize market stability and steady appreciation
- Reference housing diversity where relevant
- Use local market dynamics from context documents

### 6. EXPANSION REQUIREMENTS

- Expand the content with local details (aim for 1.5-2x length)
- Add specific examples using South Jersey locations
- Expand each main point with meaningful local detail

### 7. TONE & STYLE

- Maintain analytical, no-nonsense, informative tone
- Be specific and concrete, not generic or vague
- Sound like a local expert
- Keep the helpful, educational approach

### 8. HTML FORMATTING

- Preserve the HTML structure exactly (headings, paragraphs, lists, links, etc.)
- Keep WordPress-compatible formatting
- Maintain all existing link hrefs unchanged

### 9. AUTHENTICITY

- Every geographic reference should be real and accurate
- Use the provided context documents
- Don't make up statistics
