<p>If you've been following real estate news lately, you've probably seen headlines claiming home prices are flat across the country. But here in South Jersey, the real story is much more nuanced. Whether you're looking in Haddonfield, Cherry Hill, Washington Township, Mullica Hill, or Pitman, the reality is that our local markets don't always follow national trends.</p>
<p><strong>In most South Jersey towns, prices aren't flat at all – they're telling a much more interesting story.</strong></p>
<h4><strong>What South Jersey's Housing Data Actually Shows</strong></h4>
<p>While we've certainly seen price moderation compared to the rapid climb of 2020-2022, South Jersey's five-county region (Gloucester, Camden, Burlington, Salem, and Cumberland) is experiencing varied price trends that largely depend on which town you're looking at and available inventory.</p>
<p>In fact, if we look at recent data across our region, we see Gloucester County towns like Woolwich and Mullica Hill still experiencing modest price increases due to their proximity to Philadelphia (just 25 minutes away) and limited inventory. Meanwhile, parts of Camden County such as Cherry Hill have seen prices stabilize, and some Cumberland County areas like Vineland have experienced slight cooling as more inventory has become available.</p>

<p>One driving factor in our local market? Available inventory. As the <em>Joint Center for Housing Studies (JCHS) of Harvard University </em><a href="https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/blog/home-prices-decline-growing-number-markets-inventories-climb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explains</a>:</p>
<blockquote><em>" . . . price trends are beginning to diverge in markets across the country. </em><strong><em>Prices are declining in a growing number of markets where inventories have soared while they continue to climb in markets where for-sale inventories remain tight</em></strong><em>."</em></blockquote>
<p>This perfectly describes what we're seeing across South Jersey. In Moorestown and Haddonfield, where inventory remains extremely limited, prices continue to inch upward. Meanwhile, in areas of Gloucester Township and parts of Salem County where more homes have come on the market, we're seeing modest price adjustments.</p>
<p>Even in areas experiencing slight corrections, most South Jersey homeowners remain well ahead on their investments. Properties in towns like Sewell, Marlton, and Medford have seen roughly 45-50% appreciation over the past five years, putting most homeowners in a strong equity position despite any recent moderation.</p>
<p>So, what does this mean for you specifically in our South Jersey market?</p>
<h4><strong>If You're Buying in South Jersey...</strong></h4>
<p>Your experience will vary dramatically depending on which town you're targeting. This is why having hyper-local knowledge is so critical in our diverse region.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In competitive markets like Haddonfield, Moorestown, or Mullica Hill</strong>, waiting could mean paying more. We're still seeing multiple offers on well-priced homes in these towns, often within the first weekend of listing. A recent 4-bedroom colonial in Mullica Hill received five offers and sold for $15,000 above asking price.</li>
<li><strong>In markets like parts of Gloucester Township, West Deptford, or Cumberland County</strong> where inventory has increased, you may have more negotiating power. We recently helped buyers in Blackwood (Gloucester Township) negotiate $10,000 in seller concessions for closing costs and secure a roof credit after inspection.</li>
</ul>
<p>The bottom line for South Jersey buyers? <strong>Understanding the specific dynamics of towns like Cherry Hill versus Woodbury versus Pennsville puts you at a significant advantage.</strong> South Jersey's varied market means opportunities exist, but they look different depending on which exit you take off the AC Expressway or I-295.</p>
<h4><strong>If You're Selling in South Jersey...</strong></h4>
<p>You need to understand how your specific town's market is performing, as pricing strategies vary significantly across our five counties.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In towns like Moorestown, Cherry Hill, and Mullica Hill</strong> where inventory remains tight, you may still enjoy a relatively straightforward selling experience with fewer concessions. A recent 3-bedroom ranch in Mount Laurel sold within four days with no inspection contingencies.</li>
<li><strong>In areas like parts of Woodbury, Williamstown, or Vineland</strong> where more inventory is available, precise pricing becomes critical. We recently advised a seller in Deptford to price their home $15,000 lower than they initially wanted, resulting in multiple offers and a final price $10,000 above their original target.</li>
</ul>
<p>South Jersey sellers also need to understand our unique New Jersey closing process, including the 3-day attorney review period and the seller's responsibility for realty transfer taxes (approximately $2-$4 per $500 of purchase price, with additional fees for homes over $1 million). Proper preparation for these New Jersey-specific requirements can make your transaction much smoother.</p>
<h4><strong>The Real Story Is Your South Jersey Neighborhood</strong></h4>
<p>National headlines can provide context, but South Jersey's diverse communities don't follow a single trend. The experience of selling a historic home in Pitman differs dramatically from selling a newly built property in Woolwich Township or a rancher in Marlton.</p>
<p>As Anthony Smith, Senior Economist<em> at Realtor.com</em>, <a href="https://www.inman.com/2025/09/30/price-growth-continues-to-slow-but-economists-say-that-may-be-good-news-for-the-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><em>"While national prices continued to climb, local market conditions have become increasingly fragmented…</em><strong><em>This regional divide is expected to continue influencing price dynamics and sales activity as the fall season gets underway.</em></strong><em>"</em></blockquote>
<p>This fragmentation is exactly what we're seeing across Camden, Gloucester, Burlington, Salem, and Cumberland counties. Each community is responding to different supply-demand dynamics, town-specific amenities (like Haddonfield's walkable downtown or Pitman's historic character), and proximity factors (like Washington Township's easy access to Philadelphia via Route 42).</p>
<p><strong>Working with an agent who understands the specific market conditions in your South Jersey community is more important than ever.</strong> Whether you're looking at the $400K-$700K range in Cherry Hill, the more affordable $200K-$400K options in Salem County, or the premium $500K-$1M+ properties in Haddonfield, local expertise makes all the difference.</p>
<p>We can provide detailed data on exactly how long homes are taking to sell in your specific neighborhood, what concessions buyers are requesting during New Jersey's attorney review period, and how to navigate our state's unique closing requirements, including the Senior Freeze property tax reimbursement program for eligible seniors.</p>
<h3>Bottom Line</h3>
<p>Headlines claiming flat home prices nationally simply don't capture what's happening in Gloucester, Camden, Burlington, Salem, and Cumberland counties. Each South Jersey town tells its own unique story.</p>
