## ‚úçÔ∏è WRITE LIKE PEOPLE TALK

### Sentence DNA
- **10-15 words** = Perfect
- **16-20 words** = Acceptable
- **21+ words** = Rewrite

### Active Voice Conversion Chart
| Passive ‚ùå | Active ‚úÖ |

## üìç LOCATION STRATEGY (MAXIMUM IMPACT)

### The 3-Touch Rule
**Touch 1:** Headline or H1 (County or Region)
**Touch 2:** First paragraph (Specific town example)
**Touch 3:** Case study or statistic (Different town)

**That's it. No more geographic mentions.**

### Smart Substitutions
Instead of repeating towns, use:
- "Local homeowners"
- "Area buyers"  
- "Regional market"
- "Your neighborhood"
- "South Jersey families"

## üöÄ SEO WITHOUT THE FLUFF

### Keyword Integration (Natural > Forced)
**Primary:** Appears in:
- Title/H1
- First 100 words
- One H2
- Last 100 words

**Secondary:** Sprinkle naturally 2-3 times

**DON'T:** Stuff keywords awkwardly
**DO:** Use variations and related terms

### Google's Dream Structure
```html
<h1>Question People Actually Ask</h1>
<p>Direct 40-word answer</p>
<h2>Specific Sub-Question #1</h2>
<p>Clear answer + local example</p>
<h2>Specific Sub-Question #2</h2>
