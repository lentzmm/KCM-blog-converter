# SUPER SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS (Like You're 10)

## What You Need to Do

I messed up and made this too complicated with branches. Here's how to fix it:

---

## Step 1: Open Your Folder
Go to: `C:\Users\lentz\Dropbox\GitHub\KCM-blog-converter`

---

## Step 2: Right-Click → Git Bash Here
This opens a black window where you can type commands.

---

## Step 3: Type These Commands (One at a Time)

### Command 1: Switch to main
```bash
git checkout main
```
Press Enter. You should see: "Switched to branch 'main'"

### Command 2: Pull the latest code
```bash
git pull
```
Press Enter. You should see: "Already up to date" or files updating.

---

## Step 4: Run the Server
Now double-click: **`start-kcm-converter-CLEAN.bat`**

This is the NEW file that clears cache and shows errors.

---

## Step 5: Test It
Convert a blog post and watch the black server window for errors.

---

## That's It!

From now on:
- Always use `main` branch (not those weird claude/fix branches)
- Always use `start-kcm-converter-CLEAN.bat` to start the server
- Watch the black window for red ❌ errors

---

## If You See Red Errors
Take a screenshot and send it to me. The errors will tell us exactly what's wrong.

---

## What I Fixed

All your Yoast SEO fixes are now in `main` branch:
- ✅ Sentence length requirements
- ✅ Subheading distribution
- ✅ New diagnostic BAT file
- ✅ Better error messages

No more complicated branches!
